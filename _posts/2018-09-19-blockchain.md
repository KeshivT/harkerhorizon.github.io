# Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the advancements in blockchain technology, its long-term potential, its impact on the society and the changes in policy needed before it is adopted in mainstream. Specifically, this paper analyzes the unique characteristics of this new technology, its broad applications beyond cryptocurrency as a new digital financial instrument, and the need for regulations and governance.
This paper answers two main questions:

- Is the blockchain technology as revolutionary as the Internet technology was in the 1990s?

- What changes need to be in place for blockchain to be adopted in mainstream?

To address point 1, we analyze the applications and the impact of blockchain in various fields along with a comparison to the Internet adoption in the 90s with respect to a functional and behavioral impact on the end users. Furthermore, to address the mainstream adoption in point 2, we delve into the risks and challenges of the technology in its present form and plausible governance mechanisms which could help gain mainstream applicability.	
Research Methodology
Literature was collected from libraries, scholarly databases, analysts’ reports, and traditional databases to research the blockchain technology and its applications. Additionally, other research was conducted on other revolutionary technologies in the past and the reasons for their success or failure. Based on the research notes, the primary reasons for the potential success and challenges of blockchain were identified. Finally, the research was synthesized to develop a solution for mainstream adoption of blockchain.
Introduction and Background
History
Bitcoin was created in 2008 by a pseudo-anonymous person named ‘Satoshi Nakamoto’ and was released to the public as an open-source application in 2009 (“A Virtual Currency in a Physical World”). Nakamoto’s nine-page white paper, Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System shook the financial world and its ripples were felt from Silicon Valley to Shanghai since efficient cross-border payments could have global impact.
Definition
Blockchain is a “trustless” authentication and verification technology (Kiviat). The unique feature of blockchain is that it is not controlled by any central authority. It is based on trust in a shared public ledger that everyone can view but the ledger can only be modified with collective agreement (The Trust Machine: The Promise of the Blockchain). Past transactions can be recorded without dispute in this distributed database. And finally, for the first time in history, exchanges for value over a computer network can be verified, monitored, and enforced without the presence of a trusted third party or a central institution. 
Technology
The advantage of blockchain technology is that it facilitates business and financial transactions without the need for a common central institution. The trust that people currently place in central authorities is replaced by placing trust in machines. With blockchain, you can now execute cross-border transactions in a globally distributed network which offers transparent, permanent, unquestionable, reliable records which eliminate fraud and dishonesty (Blockchain Equity Research Analyst Report, Credit Suisse).
In a survey conducted by Credit Suisse in August 2016 shown in Fig. 1, approximately 80% of the respondents listed reduced operational costs and shortened settlement time as the main benefits of blockchain technology followed by reduced risk, greater revenue opportunities, and reduced cost of capital as additional advantages.

Applications
The first application of blockchain technology is in the creation of a whole new world of digital financial instruments. Cryptocurrency and Bitcoin in particular, is the talk of the town. Money as a medium of exchange has always evolved and taken different forms since the beginning of mankind - cattle, seashells, gold, bearer bonds, dollars, and now finally cryptocurrency in the form of Bitcoin. 
In addition to cryptocurrency, blockchain can cast a wider net to maximize its potential. Blockchain applications are seamless, real-time systems and can be used to automate and speed up the processing of digital assets like stocks, bonds, property titles, gift card points, trade settlements or clearing interbank payments.
According to PitchBook Fintech Report as shown in Fig. 2, even though Bitcoin financing was 100% of blockchain activity in 2011, with widespread use of blockchain in other applications, Bitcoin investments fell to 70% of the blockchain activity in 2016.

Blockchain’s impacts on other fields can be seen from blockchain crypto-contracts applicability in real estate and business transactions to recording elections.  According to Larry Summers, President of Harvard University, “40 years from now blockchain and all that followed from it will figure more prominently in that story than Bitcoin” (Blockchain Equity Research Analyst Report, Credit Suisse). The technology can be used to replace the infinite usernames and password necessary for identity management or develop secure online voting systems among other such applications. In a survey conducted by Credit Suisse on Bitcoin and blockchain thought leaders, as shown in Fig. 3, even though approximately 80% of respondents listed Finance as the main industry to be transformed by the impact of blockchain, the respondents also listed identity management, property title, and communication as other areas to be shaken up by blockchain potential.

 Additionally, it is interesting to note the increasing electric power requirements of blockchain as represented in the chart in Fig. 4 below. Bitcoin draws twelve times the power that was required by eBay servers in 2013, six times the power of Facebook data farms in 2012, and twice the power required by Google in 2011.

Moreover, the buzz of blockchain can be felt globally from Silicon Valley to Shanghai as exhibited in Fig. 5. Currently, blockchain has generated a 42% interest level in North America, followed by 30% interest in Europe, and 22% in Asia.

Is Blockchain Revolutionary?
Revolution by definition signifies change. The most important technical breakthrough which led to a successful Industrial revolution was the development of steam engine. It enabled mass production of manufactured goods, increased standard of living and led to population growth. Computers and Internet led to the Internet revolution which have led to increased productivity, changed our social interactions, and growth in the services industry. The blockchain technology will similarly transform the digital age with its potential in digital records, which, in turn, will transform businesses and companies, and enhance the economy. Similar to other technological advances, Blockchain’s value is hard to predict and the road to its success might be long and lonely with obstacles and delayed adoption.
History shows that the time span between a technological invention and its widespread adoption has been shortening. Whereas it took 200 years from development of steam engine to a reliable, affordable car by Henry Ford, it took only 20 years between ENIAC, IBM’s first computer to mass production of computers (Makridakis). Smartphones have broken all records in terms of innovation, adoption, and growth. Though blockchain was first conceptualized in 2008 and implemented in 2009, as shown in Fig. 6, the current hype is likely to generate a steep increase in the projected growth grate for blockchain from 2017 to a peak of 120% in 2020. Possibly as the mania subsides along with the rules and regulations falling in place, we will likely see a decline in blockchain growth rate from 2020-2023. Eventually, once there is more clarity and structure, we will see blockchain technology picking up and settling into a steady growth rate by 2030. Additionally, blockchain business value is projected to steadily increase at an alarming rate from approximately $176 billion in 2025 to approximately $3 trillion by 2030 (Figure 6).

Comparing blockchain growth to Internet user growth, as can be seen in Fig. 7, the number of Internet users grew steadily from 0.1 billion in 1996 to 2.6 billion in 2013 whereas its year-over-year growth rate peaked at 60% in 1997 and was followed by a steep decline till 2001; it then gradually started settling down at approximately 109% year-over-year growth rate of 20%.

The Internet, having its origins in the TCP/IP protocol since 1972, gained mass adoption in the 1990s with advent of the requisite infrastructure (i.e., world wide web, software languages and hardware products) and low-cost connectivity using Internet services like Netscape, AOL, Yahoo, Expedia, CNET etc. which made compelling substitutes for existing solutions. Similarly, the blockchain adoption is being based on two factors: the infrastructure of the blockchain database itself and low cost of data and transaction processing that allows data to be verified within microseconds using large number of identical databases maintained by each interested party to the data. Akin to the Internet, which caused a revolutionary shift in functional and psychological behaviors of consumers from offline to online communications and transactions, blockchain heralds the shift in the manner at which individuals and organizations will look at any kind of data. When scaled sufficiently, blockchain will create a new economy that will eliminate the need of any kind of an intermediary, like a banker, lawyer, broker or even a digital security system to verify any transaction (pertaining to service/goods), tasks, agreements or data stored for analysis and records. Admittedly, this is still a few years away from being a revolution, and there are several challenges and steps, which we discuss later, to be enacted to achieve mainstream scalability. However, it has immense potential to transform the behavioral and functional patterns of businesses and individuals with respect to data and transaction processing.
Impact on Society
With continued and broad-based adoption of the Internet, the society has transformed at an unbelievable rate. According to Jeremy Allaire, CEO, Circle Internet Financial Inc.’s testimony before the Senate committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, the rise of peer-to-peer computing, establishment of decentralized networks, advancement in cryptography, increase in global trade, all drive the need for more secure, cost-effective, and private systems (McGlynn). 
According to the Blockchain Equity Research Analyst Report by Credit Suisse, “The Internet is driving a shift towards networks and platform-based social and economic models. Assets can be shared, creating not just new efficiencies but also whole new business models and opportunities for social self-organization.”
Businesses unwilling or hesitant to adapt to new technologies have to change their ways of thinking and think creatively to rise to the challenge of the new opportunities and potential of the technology. The government has to rise to the challenge since there is always a gap between early adoption of technology and government reacting to put regulations in place. 
Bitcoin has its own share of disbelievers and it has been compared to Dante’s Inferno by Sir Howard Davies, chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland. Davies called the cryptocurrency a “frothy investment bubble” since it seems to be based on excessive optimism and speculation than sound economic principles (Partington). Similar to the other bubbles, the Bitcoin frenzy can be attributed to “spontaneous urge to action” and sway of emotions by people (Shiller). Comparing the speculative Bitcoin bubble to the outrageous tulip mania of the 17th century and the messy dotcom bubble of the late 1990s, former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan’s coined term “irrational exuberance” can also be applied to the Bitcoin frenzy (Partington). 
Society has witnessed and benefited from many revolutions in the past: The Industrial Revolution (inventions of water power, steam power, assembly line, electricity), the Internet revolution (computer and automation), and the current digital age transformation (AI and Blockchain). These digital technologies will continue to impact billions of people through the web. 
With respect to the finance industry, which was 70% of blockchain activity in 2016, ex-Barclays chief Antony Jenkins predicted that the entire global banking industry will undergo major changes on account of blockchain and about 20% to 50% of bank employees would lose their jobs (Toesland). Additionally, in a recent report by Santander Innoventures, management consultancy Oliver Wyman and venture capitalist Anthemis have forecasted annual savings of $15 billion to $20 billion by 2022. Since the banks will lose their clearing fees on account of blockchain implementation, the banks will need to look for new revenue sources. In the fear of missing the boat, most of the financial institutions have started exploring and investing in blockchain technology.
Slowly, Bitcoin is beginning to be accepted as a mode of payment starting with a few online retailers like travel website Expedia, computer and electronics retailers Newegg and TigerDirect, Dell, television provider Dish Network, and retailer Overstock.com.
Benefits of Blockchain
The rewards of blockchain technology combined with its far-reaching effects are significant. First, it helps prevent fraudulent systems since individuals who do not know or trust each other can enter into transactions and exchange assets safely and reliably. As all transactions are recorded in the public ledger, everyone can view all transactions and there is true transparency. Bitcoin is better than regular currency since it has lower transaction costs, doesn’t require cost and time in managing it, and it increases security of personal information. Blockchain has the potential to transform developing economies which lack the infrastructure capabilities but have smartphone accessibility and it can reshape the financial system (Duke Law). Blockchain technology enables more efficient title transfers, owner verification and “smart contracts”. It leads to more scrutiny on the government and banks and provides more transparency. Finally, its enormous potential as a new, robust, online network that doesn’t depend on the government or digital media giants is unlimited (Conway).
Challenges for mainstream adoption
Industry sectors that have already invested heavily in improving their business processes will not be a good fit for the application of blockchain technology. For example, in consumer payments and pre-trade disciplines, execution already happens in milliseconds and blockchain will not improve efficiency. As with any new technology, blockchain currently lacks centralized governance or a regulatory system. Widespread adoption of blockchain will face resistance from “trustworthy institutions” such as banks, clearing houses, and government agencies which handle trustworthy transactions.
One of the primary challenges of Bitcoin is its extreme price volatility. As reflected in its one-year price increase of over 1900% in 2017 as shown in Fig.8, these drastic changes limit its use as a store of value. Additional barriers include multi-million dollar hacks, reputation of scandal and fraud after the collapse of Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange, the tarnished reputation with the Silk Road case, and user anonymity which could potentially lead to drugs/illegal use, money laundering or tax evasion.

Some of the major hurdles in the adoption of blockchain technology could be slow transaction confirmation time, high energy costs from mining power, scalability issues to process large transactions, irreversibility of transactions, and irrecoverable account management in event of hacking or loss of password. (Blockchain Equity Research Analyst Report, Credit Suisse).
Regulations and Governance
Although currently in its infancy stage, government regulations and scrutiny are inevitable even before blockchain becomes mainstream. In the case of Bitcoin, its growing popularity led Chris Burniske, an analyst at ARK Investment Management to note that “We are seeing regulators grapple with how to regulate and tax [cryptocurrencies]” (Woolf). As with any new advancement, the Bitcoin popularity is ahead of the regulators. It is critical that startups, visionaries, and regulators work together to support the new innovation. Undoubtedly, there is a tradeoff between privacy, the foundation of the blockchain model, and credibility of the new instrument. The state of status quo regulations led Kevin McIntyre, associate professor of economics at McDaniel College in Maryland, to state that “If Bitcoin and other digital currencies are going to be viewed as legitimate financial instruments, there has to be some regulatory apparatus here,” (Woolf). Financial stability can be endangered with the increasing use of the volatile digital currency. Government regulation enables increased faith in the system but entails more scrutiny. In the process of regulating the financial applications of blockchain, care should be taken not to slow down the adoption of the other applications of blockchain.
Conclusions
As with any new technology, it is difficult to predict the future of blockchain and its impact on society, businesses, employment, and socio-economic structures. Blockchain technology based on the idea of shared public ledgers has the potential to transform how people and businesses function in the society. Similar to the Internet buzz, blockchain technology is undeniably powerful and it will have significant impact on financial institutions, voting, smart devices, supply chains, and business contracts. The promise of blockchain with its transparent, authentic, and real-time auditing and verification has just begun to scratch the surface in every business process and will lead to reduction in corruption, errors, and fraud. Even though blockchain is considered as a “disruptive” technology by few, the technology is based on sound principles and will have deep and long-reaching effects which will transform the global economy. Countries like UK, Canada, Russia, China, and Australia are already working towards a crypto/digital currency. Moreover, developing countries with poor infrastructure will be able to overcome their disadvantage and have access to equal opportunities similar to the developed countries with the blockchain technology. 
The current political, business, and societal environment has to adapt to the new revolution rising in the blockchain technology. Though the adoption of blockchain will be slow due to lot of mining power needs, high energy costs, and scalability issues, the growth and evolution of blockchain is the next big breakthrough. Finally, as blockchain increases its mainstream presence, the security and regulatory challenges will prevail in the near future.
