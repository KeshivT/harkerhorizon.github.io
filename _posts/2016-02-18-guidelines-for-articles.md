title: "Guidelines for Articles"
---

An Article is an in-depth research report detailing observations, discoveries, and the analysis of your findings from a scientific investigation. Articles should aim to advance their respective fields, relaying these findings in a formal, sophisticated manner. Articles should be written with the target audience of peer scientists well-versed in your field, but they should not rely on the understanding of technical jargon or other esoteric references for comprehension. Strive to provide a complete, unobstructed outlook on all facets of your investigation, including any shortcomings or unexplainable conclusions. All references to separate papers or any information used originating from outside sources must be referenced using proper APA citations.

Formatting Guidelines:

Article format guidelines provide a strict outline for your paper to adhere to; submissions must conform to the below subheading structure.
The content of each section of the Article must make an obvious attempt to fulfill the category requirements and answer the provided questions in each category below.

Abstract:
Each Article submission must include a separate abstract, providing a concise overview of the investigation for readers. Abstracts may not exceed a 350 word limit.

Abstracts must include the following content:

1. Objective or Purpose of study
2. Methods Used / Testing Procedure
3. Main Outcome Measures (Main Metrics/Parameters being measured in the study)
4. Brief Overview of Results
5. Conclusions and Future Work

Content

1. Introduction
    1. Each Article must begin with an introduction giving background information and general insight into the scientific problem.
    2. Questions to ask yourself:
        1. Why is this study important? What hypothesis is being tested? What have important past publications already revealed about the issue you are tackling?
2. Methods or Testing Procedures
    1. These procedures should be written with sufficient detail to allow peers in the field to replicate your work.
    2. Questions to ask yourself:
        1. How was the experiment carried out? What parts of the experimental procedure did you design yourself? What instrumentation was used? What experimental dependencies exist (i.e. instrumentation, processing power)?
3. Results
    1. This section provides quantitative and qualitative results, both numerically and graphically. Trends in the data are highlighted, and numbers are proven to be statistically significant.
    2. Questions to ask yourself:
        1. How do my results compare to past publications? Do my findings sufficiently validate or disprove my hypothesis?
4. Discussion:
    1. Discussion uses analyzed data to address the original research question/hypothesis, making connections with related research
    2. Questions to ask yourself:
        1. What implications do my results have? Why are my results important? What do my results not address? What are the limitations to my investigation?
5. Conclusion and Future Work:
    1. This section restates important results in the context of their relevance to other work in the field. It also explains implications for future work and proposes future experiments.
    2. Questions to ask yourself:
        1. What further tests should be conducted? What next steps exist? How could I further corroborate my hypothesis? What other metrics or parameters should I measure? What implications does this investigation have in the long run or on a global scale?
6. Bibliography
    1. This section ends the Article and lists all references in proper APA citation format.
