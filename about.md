Harker Horizon is a student run journal at The Harker School that publishes peer-reviewed papers written by students. We seek to spread interest in intellectual inquiry and inform the student body of current events in the scientific community, as well as provide a platform for students to publish, read, and comment on research by their peers. For students who might be interested in pursuing research projects in the future, we hope to help contextualize the scientific method and research process. Furthermore, we want to encourage students to view scientific advancements with a critical eye by helping them understand the interdisciplinary ramifications of breaking news.
